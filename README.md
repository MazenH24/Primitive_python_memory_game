How it works: First the user must click the start button, then numbers will appear on the screen after all numbers appear on the screen, a blue rectangle will appear which means the user must type the number that appeared previously then click submit. Once the user provide a wrong number the game will end; if the user wants to play once more he or she must click the “play again?” button. If the user wants to delete a number before submitting he or she can use the backspace key.
